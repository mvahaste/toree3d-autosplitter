# Toree 3D auto splitter
A LiveSplit auto splitter for the Toree 3D Any% Glitchless speedrun.

Since this is the first time I'm doing something like this, it's a very basic script. Runs automatically start on level load, splits when you're back in the menu, and stops once you reach the final goal.

Pointer paths found January 5th, 2023. May break with future updates.
